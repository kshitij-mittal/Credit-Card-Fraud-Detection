As a part of the Data Science for Consulting Course - University of Chicago (Masters of Science in Analytics) 

# Situation
Our client is an IT company which provides backend systems to help retailers manage their inventories well
<br/>
They are using external assistance to detect fraudulent credit card transactions 
<br/>
The model right now has many caveats:
<br/>
- In many instances, genuine payments are also declined
  <br/>
- It classifies many good transactions as fraudulent
  <br/>
- It does ‘too good of a job’
  <br/>
The client wants a new algorithm that can prevent good transactions being classified as fraudulent. 
They also want the new algorithm to be easier to explain
